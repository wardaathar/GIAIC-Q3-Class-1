2. 💻 Using Google Colab
Write and run Python code in the browser

No installation required

3. 🧠 Difference Between CPU & GPU
🟦 CPU (Central Processing Unit)
Performs one task at a time

Best for:

General-purpose tasks

Low-latency operations

Sequential computations

Python interpreter usually runs on CPU

🟩 GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
Executes many tasks in parallel

Best for:

Deep learning

Scientific computing

Tasks needing high-speed calculations

Python libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch can use GPU for faster processing

👩‍💻 Happy Learning!
